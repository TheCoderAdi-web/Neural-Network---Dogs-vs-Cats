NOTE: There is no way to test the neural network. For those who want to use this network, there are no X_train or Y_train variables, you will have to add them yourself.
This neural network is made using os, numpy, multiprocessing and more. This is made using pure python and the following packages. It does not use any shortcuts like keras, 
and instead has simple classes like ReLu and Soft_Max. Thus, It runs extremely slowly, so make sure you heed this warning.
